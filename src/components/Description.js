        The examples provided below are intended to be a helpful guide. As per
        the guide for use [below], the examples are based on an impairment of
        functioning approach. As such, these examples are not intended to be
        definitions of disability but associative functional descriptors.
        Intellectual Applies to conditions appearing in the developmental period
        (age 0–18 years) associated with impairments of mental functions,
        difficulties in learning and performing certain daily life skills and
        limitations of adaptive skills in the context of community environments
        compared to others of the same age. Includes: Down syndrome, tuberous
        sclerosis, cri-du-chat syndrome. Specific learning/Attention Deficit
        Disorder (ADD) (other than intellectual)—learning disability is a
        general term referring to a group of disabilities, presumed due to
        central nervous system dysfunction rather than an intellectual
        disability, covering significant difficulties in the acquisition and use
        of organisational skills, listening, speaking, reading, writing,
        reasoning or mathematical skills.

        Autism (including Asperger's syndrome and Pervasive Developmental
        Delay)—Autism is used to describe pervasive developmental disorders
        involving disturbances in cognition, interpersonal communication, social
        interactions and behaviour (in particular obsessive, ritualistic,
        stereotyped and rigid behaviours). Physical Used to describe conditions
        that are attributable to a physical cause or impact on the ability to
        perform physical activities, such as mobility. Physical disability often
        includes impairments of the neuromusculoskeletal systems including, for
        example, the effects of paraplegia, quadriplegia, muscular dystrophy,
        motor neurone disease, neuromuscular disorders, cerebral palsy, absence
        or deformities of limbs, spina bifida, arthritis, back disorders,
        ataxia, bone formation or degeneration, scoliosis. Includes: impairments
        of the neuromusculoskeletal systems including, for example, the effects
        of paraplegia, quadriplegia, muscular dystrophy, motor neurone disease,
        neuromuscular disorders, cerebral palsy, absence or deformities of
        limbs, spina bifida, arthritis, back disorders, ataxia, bone formation
        or degeneration, scoliosis. Acquired brain injury Acquired brain injury
        is used to describe multiple disabilities arising from damage to the
        brain acquired after birth. Results in deterioration in cognitive,
        physical, emotional or independent functioning. May be as a result of
        accidents, stroke, brain tumours, infection, poisoning, lack of oxygen
        or degenerative neurological disease. Neurological (including epilepsy
        and Alzheimer's disease) Applies to impairments of the nervous system
        occurring after birth, includes epilepsy and organic dementias (for
        example, Alzheimer’s disease) as well as such conditions as multiple
        sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease. Deafblind (dual sensory) refers to
        dual sensory impairments associated with severe restrictions in
        communication, and participation in community life. Deafblindness is not
        just vision impairment with a hearing loss, or a hearing loss with a
        vision impairment. Deafblindness is a unique disability of its own
        requiring distinct communication and teaching practices. Vision
        encompasses blindness and vision impairment (not corrected by glasses or
        contact lenses), which can cause severe restriction in communication and
        mobility, and in the ability to participate in community life. Hearing
        encompasses deafness, hearing impairment, hearing loss. Speech
        encompasses speech loss, impairment and/or difficulty in being
        understood. Psychiatric Psychiatric disability includes recognisable
        symptoms and behaviour patterns, frequently associated with distress,
        which may impair personal functioning in normal social activity.
        Includes the typical effects of conditions such as schizophrenia,
        affective disorders, anxiety disorders, addictive behaviours,
        personality disorders, stress, psychosis, depression and adjustment
        disorders. For psychiatric disability one would normally expect there to
        be a diagnosis. General issues with behaviour (where there is no
        specific diagnosis) should be reflected in the support needs data (for
        example, support needs in relation to ‘interpersonal interactions and
        relationships’) rather than here in ‘disability group’. Includes:
        schizophrenia, affective disorders, anxiety disorders, addictive
        behaviours, personality disorders, stress, psychosis, depression and
        adjustment disorders. Developmental delay applies to children aged 0–5
        where conditions have appeared in the early developmental period, but no
        specific diagnosis has been made and the specific disability group is
        not yet known. Guide for use Disability groups are a broad
        categorisation of disabilities in terms of underlying health condition,
        impairment, activity limitations, participation restrictions and
        environmental factors. The primary disability is the disability that
        most clearly expresses the experience of disability by a person. It can
        also be considered as the disability group causing the most difficulty
        to the person (overall difficulty in daily life, not just within the
        context of the support offered). A person’s functioning or disability is
        conceived as a dynamic interaction between a person with a health
        condition(s) and environmental and personal factors (WHO 2001).
        Functioning and disability are both multidimensional concepts.
        Disability is the umbrella term for any or all of an impairment of body
        structure or function, a limitation in activities (the tasks a person
        does), or a restriction in participation (the involvement of a person in
        life situations). The International Classification of Functioning,
        Disability and Health (ICF) recognises two main components of
        functioning and disability: a body component comprising classifications
        of Body Function and Body Structure; and an Activities and Participation
        component providing a complete set of domains for aspects of functioning
        from both an individual and societal perspective. Environmental factors
        represent an important new component of the ICF in recognition of their
        influence on functioning and disability. Personal factors are also
        recognised but are not classified. The disability groupings are a broad
        description of similar experiences of disability and patterns of
        impairments, activity limitations, participation restrictions, support
        needs and related health conditions. ‘Disability group’ is not a
        diagnostic grouping, and there is not a one-to-one correspondence
        between a health condition and a disability group. This data item should
        ideally reflect the views of both the person and the funded agency. If
        there is a difference, the funded agency’s assessment should be
        recorded. (If the primary disability group cannot easily be chosen, then
        define primary disability as the person’s disability to which the
        service caters.)
