            The examples provided below are intended to be a helpful guide. As
            per the guide for use [below], the examples are based on an
            impairment of functioning approach. As such, these examples are not
            intended to be definitions of disability but associative functional
            descriptors. Intellectual Applies to conditions appearing in the
            developmental period (age 0–18 years) associated with impairments of
            mental functions, difficulties in learning and performing certain
            daily life skills and limitations of adaptive skills in the context
            of community environments compared to others of the same age.
            Includes: Down syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, cri-du-chat syndrome.
            Specific learning/Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) (other than
            intellectual)—learning disability is a general term referring to a
            group of disabilities, presumed due to central nervous system
            dysfunction rather than an intellectual disability, covering
            significant difficulties in the acquisition and use of
            organisational skills, listening, speaking, reading, writing,
            reasoning or mathematical skills.

            Acquired brain injury Acquired brain injury is used to describe
            multiple disabilities arising from damage to the brain acquired
            after birth. Results in deterioration in cognitive, physical,
            emotional or independent functioning. May be as a result of
            accidents, stroke, brain tumours, infection, poisoning, lack of
            oxygen or degenerative neurological disease. Neurological (including
            epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease) Applies to impairments of the
            nervous system occurring after birth, includes epilepsy and organic
            dementias (for example, Alzheimer’s disease) as well as such
            conditions as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease. Deafblind
            (dual sensory) refers to dual sensory impairments associated with
            severe restrictions in communication, and participation in community
            life. Deafblindness is not just vision impairment with a hearing
            loss, or a hearing loss with a vision impairment. Deafblindness is a
            unique disability of its own requiring distinct communication and
            teaching practices. Vision encompasses blindness and vision
            impairment (not corrected by glasses or contact lenses), which can
            cause severe restriction in communication and mobility, and in the
            ability to participate in community life. Hearing encompasses
            deafness, hearing impairment, hearing loss. Speech encompasses
            speech loss, impairment and/or difficulty in being understood.
            Psychiatric Psychiatric disability includes recognisable symptoms
            and behaviour patterns, frequently associated with distress, which
            may impair personal functioning in normal social activity. Includes
            the typical effects of conditions such as schizophrenia, affective
            disorders, anxiety disorders, addictive behaviours, personality
            disorders, stress, psychosis, depression and adjustment disorders.

            What are the Criteria for Getting a Disability Certificate? Any
            person suffering from the disabilities listed above is eligible to
            apply for a disability certificate. However, when the medical board
            does the disability evaluation — the certificate is issued only to
            those who fulfil any of the following criteria: Person must have a
            minimum of 35% mental handicap or disability Person must have an
            orthopaedic disability of minimum 40% In the case of deaf people,
            the disability percentage must be between 90 dB & 100 dB Visual
            impairment has to be more than 90%

            Apply In-Person The person with disability will have to personally
            present at the local health centre for examination before a
            certificate can be issued. A well-wisher, caregiver or guardian of a
            person with disability can help in the process. The well-wisher or
            the person himself/herself, should approach the District hospital
            with his/her request for obtaining Disability Certificate providing
            the following documents: – Referral paper from the local health
            centre as applicable Copy of Government Approved I.D. (Aadhar
            Card/PAN Card/Driving License etc.) of the person with disability
            and 2 photographs showing the disabled part. Copy of all medical and
            psychological reports available. Medical Board distributes the cases
            to the medical sub-committees specialized for different types of
            disabilities, according to the medical diagnosis of the person with
            disability. Medical Board issues the Disability Certificate to the
            person with disability that he should receive from the District
            Hospital, after its verification by the Head of the Medical Board.
            The State Governments / UT Administrations may constitute the
            medical boards The Director-General of Health Services Ministry of
            Health and Family Welfare will be the final authority, should there
            arise any controversy/doubt regarding the interpretation of the
            definitions/classifications/evaluation tests, etc.

            For psychiatric disability one would normally expect there to be a
            diagnosis. General issues with behaviour (where there is no specific
            diagnosis) should be reflected in the support needs data (for
            example, support needs in relation to ‘interpersonal interactions
            and relationships’) rather than here in ‘disability group’.
            Includes: schizophrenia, affective disorders, anxiety disorders,
            addictive behaviours, personality disorders, stress, psychosis,
            depression and adjustment disorders. Developmental delay applies to
            children aged 0–5 where conditions have appeared in the early
            developmental period, but no specific diagnosis has been made and
            the specific disability group is not yet known. Guide for use
            Disability groups are a broad categorisation of disabilities in
            terms of underlying health condition, impairment, activity
            limitations, participation restrictions and environmental factors.
            The primary disability is the disability that most clearly expresses
            the experience of disability by a person. It can also be considered
            as the disability group causing the most difficulty to the person
            (overall difficulty in daily life, not just within the context of
            the support offered). A person’s functioning or disability is
            conceived as a dynamic interaction between a person with a health
            condition(s) and environmental and personal factors (WHO 2001).
            Functioning and disability are both multidimensional concepts.
            Disability is the umbrella term for any or all of an impairment of
            body structure or function, a limitation in activities (the tasks a
            person does), or a restriction in participation (the involvement of
            a person in life situations).

            Autism (including Asperger's syndrome and Pervasive Developmental
            Delay)—Autism is used to describe pervasive developmental disorders
            involving disturbances in cognition, interpersonal communication,
            social interactions and behaviour (in particular obsessive,
            ritualistic, stereotyped and rigid behaviours). Physical Used to
            describe conditions that are attributable to a physical cause or
            impact on the ability to perform physical activities, such as
            mobility. Physical disability often includes impairments of the
            neuromusculoskeletal systems including, for example, the effects of
            paraplegia, quadriplegia, muscular dystrophy, motor neurone disease,
            neuromuscular disorders, cerebral palsy, absence or deformities of
            limbs, spina bifida, arthritis, back disorders, ataxia, bone
            formation or degeneration, scoliosis. Includes: impairments of the
            neuromusculoskeletal systems including, for example, the effects of
            paraplegia, quadriplegia, muscular dystrophy, motor neurone disease,
            neuromuscular disorders, cerebral palsy, absence or deformities of
            limbs, spina bifida, arthritis, back disorders, ataxia, bone
            formation or degeneration, scoliosis. The International
            Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)
            recognises two main components of functioning and disability: a body
            component comprising classifications of Body Function and Body
            Structure; and an Activities and Participation component providing a
            complete set of domains for aspects of functioning from both an
            individual and societal perspective. Environmental factors represent
            an important new component of the ICF in recognition of their
            influence on functioning and disability. Personal factors are also
            recognised but are not classified. The disability groupings are a
            broad description of similar experiences of disability and patterns
            of impairments, activity limitations, participation restrictions,
            support needs and related health conditions. ‘Disability group’ is
            not a diagnostic grouping, and there is not a one-to-one
            correspondence between a health condition and a disability group.
            This data item should ideally reflect the views of both the person
            and the funded agency. If there is a difference, the funded agency’s
            assessment should be recorded. (If the primary disability group
            cannot easily be chosen, then define primary disability as the
            person’s disability to which the service caters.

            A person’s functioning or disability is conceived as a dynamic
            interaction between a person with a health condition(s) and
            environmental and personal factors (WHO 2001). Functioning and
            disability are both multidimensional concepts. Disability is the
            umbrella term for any or all of an impairment of body structure or
            function, a limitation in activities (the tasks a person does), or a
            restriction in participation (the involvement of a person in life
            situations). The International Classification of Functioning,
            Disability and Health (ICF) recognises two main components of
            functioning and disability: a body component comprising

            Activities and Participation component providing a complete set of
            domains for aspects of functioning from both an individual and
            societal perspective. Environmental factors represent an important
